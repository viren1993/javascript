ðŸ”¹ React Hooks Usage in Projects
Question:
What kinds of React Hooks have you used in your projects, and why?

Sample Answer (AI + Real-world):
I've extensively used useState, useEffect, useRef, and useMemo. In AI-based projects or dashboard-like apps, useMemo and useCallback are essential to prevent expensive recalculations or re-renders, especially when dealing with API calls and visualizations. For shared state, I've used useContext or custom hooks.

Follow-up Q: Can you explain a custom hook you created?
A: I built a custom hook for debounced search to avoid unnecessary API calls when users type in a queryâ€”especially useful in NLP-based or ML-driven apps.

ðŸ”¹ State Management for Large-Scale Data
Question:
What state management approach do you use when working with large-scale data?

Sample Answer:
For large-scale or enterprise apps, I prefer Redux Toolkit with middleware like Redux Thunk or Saga to handle async actions cleanly. I also use RTK Query to handle API caching and auto-fetching. In performance-critical areas, I split states using useReducer locally to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

Bonus: I also use React Query in data-heavy AI dashboards to handle server state, caching, and background updates.

ðŸ”¹ Code Performance and Optimization
Question:
How do you ensure your React code is performant and optimized?

Sample Answer:
I use multiple strategies:

Component Memoization: with React.memo and useMemo

Lazy loading: with React.lazy and Suspense for route/code splitting

Virtual DOM optimizations: via selective rendering and list virtualization using React Window

Profiling: Using React DevTools Profiler to detect bottlenecks

Dependency checks: Minimizing unnecessary dependencies in useEffect

Minified bundles: via Next.js or Webpack for tree shaking

How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility when developing frontend applications using ReactJS? Can you provide an example of a challenge you faced and how you resolved it?

When developing frontend applications using ReactJS, ensuring cross-browser compatibility is crucial. I achieve this by employing modern CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid layouts, as well as using tools like Autoprefixer to handle vendor prefixes. In a recent project, I encountered a challenge with CSS Grid not rendering correctly in older versions of Internet Explorer. To address this, I implemented a combination of flexbox fallbacks and a polyfill library to ensure consistent layout across different browsers. This strategy effectively resolved the issue and maintained cross-browser compatibility.

In your opinion, what are the key considerations when designing user interfaces for responsive web applications? How do you approach responsive design in your projects?

Responsive web design is a critical aspect of modern web development. When designing user interfaces for responsive web applications, I prioritize ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. I achieve this by using flexible grid layouts, fluid images, and media queries to adapt the design to different viewports. In my previous projects, I have incorporated mobile-first design principles, ensuring that the user interface is optimized for smaller screens before scaling up to larger ones. This approach has proven effective in enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

Can you explain your experience with UI/UX design and how it relates to your frontend development skills?

In my current role as a Frontend Developer at Vashishth Technologies, I have had the opportunity to work extensively on UI/UX design principles while developing user-centric web applications. My experience with technologies like Next.js, React.js, and TypeScript has allowed me to create responsive and visually appealing interfaces that enhance user experience. I focus on understanding user needs and preferences, which helps me design interfaces that are not only functional but also intuitive. For instance, while working on the ONS Trading platform, I implemented responsive web design techniques to ensure that the application is accessible across various devices. This involved optimizing layouts and ensuring that interactive elements are easy to navigate. Additionally, I conducted user testing to gather feedback, which informed further iterations of the design. My background in frontend development complements my understanding of UI/UX, as I can effectively translate design concepts into functional code. I believe that a strong UI/UX design is crucial for user retention and satisfaction, and I strive to incorporate best practices in all my projects.

How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility in your web projects?
Ensuring cross-browser compatibility is a critical aspect of my frontend development process. Throughout my career, I have implemented various strategies to achieve this. Firstly, I always start by using semantic HTML and CSS, which are widely supported across different browsers. I also utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind, which are designed to be responsive and compatible with multiple browsers. During the development phase, I regularly test my applications on various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, to identify any discrepancies in rendering. For instance, while working on the CrSIP project, I encountered issues with CSS styles not displaying correctly in older versions of Internet Explorer. To address this, I used CSS prefixes and fallbacks to ensure that the design remained consistent. Additionally, I leverage tools like BrowserStack to simulate different environments and test my applications effectively. I also stay updated with the latest web standards and best practices, which helps me anticipate potential compatibility issues. By prioritizing cross-browser compatibility, I ensure that users have a seamless experience regardless of their browser choice.
