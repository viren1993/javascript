## **✅ Key Features of Unit Testing:
| Feature        | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolated**   | Tests a function without relying on external systems (e.g., APIs, databases). |
| **Repeatable** | Should produce the same result every time.                                    |
| **Automated**  | Usually run with test runners (like Jest, Mocha, JUnit).                      |
| **Fast**       | Because it only checks small units of logic, tests run quickly.               |

🚀 Benefits of Unit Testing:
Catches bugs early
Documents your code
Makes refactoring safer
Helps with code quality and maintainability

## **🏗️ Real DOM vs Virtual DOM
| Feature      | **Real DOM**                        | **Virtual DOM**                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Type         | Actual browser-rendered DOM         | Lightweight JS object copy of the real DOM |
| Update Speed | Slower (updates entire DOM)         | Faster (only updates changed parts)        |
| Performance  | Less efficient for frequent changes | High performance in modern frameworks      |
| Used In      | Plain HTML/JS apps                  | React, Vue, etc.                           |


## **⚙️ How Virtual DOM Works (React Example)
Initial Render:
React creates a Virtual DOM (V-DOM), a copy of the real DOM in memory.

State Change / Re-render:
When data (state/props) change, a new Virtual DOM is created.

Diffing Algorithm:
React compares the new V-DOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm.

Minimal Updates:
React identifies the exact differences and updates only those parts of the real DOM.

Efficient UI Update:
DOM updates are batched and optimized to reduce reflows/repaints.

“Virtual DOM is a fast, in-memory representation of the real DOM that React uses to efficiently update only the changed parts of the UI through diffing and reconciliation.”

Reconciliation is the process React uses to compare the old Virtual DOM with the new one and update only the parts of the real DOM that changed — instead of re-rendering the whole UI.

## **⚙️ How Reconciliation Works (Step-by-Step)
State/Props Change
→ A component receives new props or state.

New Virtual DOM Created
→ React builds a new Virtual DOM tree for the updated UI.

Diffing Algorithm Runs
→ React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one:

Compares element types

Checks keys for lists

Finds what changed (added/removed/updated)

Minimal DOM Updates
→ React updates only the changed nodes in the real DOM (this is the "reconciliation").

Efficient Rendering
→ This makes UI updates fast and smooth

## **“Reconciliation is React’s process of efficiently updating the UI by diffing the old and new Virtual DOMs and applying only the minimal real DOM changes.” **

## *What is React Fiber, and how does it improve performance?
React Fiber, introduced in React 16, enables incremental rendering, task prioritization, and smoother UI updates by breaking rendering into smaller units.
## * What are the features of React?
✅ Virtual DOM
✅ JSX (JavaScript XML)
✅ Component-based Architecture
✅ Unidirectional Data Flow
✅ Performance Optimization (e.g., useMemo, useCallback)
✅ Hooks for functional components
✅ Server-side rendering support

## *What is DOM?
- DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects that can be manipulated using JavaScript.
## *What is Virtual DOM?
- Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM.
- React creates a virtual DOM, makes changes there first, and then efficiently updates the real DOM.
## *What are Fragments in React?
- Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
## *How does React handle hydration in SSR apps?
React hydrates the server-rendered HTML by attaching event listeners and reactivating the UI on the client side for a seamless experience.
## *What is React Suspense, and how does it help with lazy loading?
Suspense waits for data before rendering, working with React.lazy() for code-splitting and improved load times.
## *Best practices to avoid unnecessary re-renders?
- Use React.memo to prevent re-renders when props don’t change.
- Optimize expensive calculations with useMemo.
- Use useCallback to memoize functions.
- Keep state localized to reduce updates.
## *What is a Service Worker?
A background script that enables offline support and caching, improving PWA performance.
## *What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing?
✅ Unit Testing tests individual functions, Integration Testing tests multiple components together, and E2E Testing tests the full user flow.
## *What is Jest, and how is it used?
✅ Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework for unit testing with features like snapshot testing and mock functions.
## *What is the purpose of React Testing Library?
✅ It tests UI behavior, not implementation details, ensuring components work as users expect.
## *What are mocks and stubs in testing?
✅ Mocks simulate dependencies, while stubs provide canned responses for predictable tests.
## *How does GraphQL differ from REST in frontend development?
✅ GraphQL allows clients to request only the needed data, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. REST, on the other hand, structures data into predefined endpoints, sometimes leading to inefficient data transfers.
## *What is stale-while-revalidate (SWR), and when should you use it?
✅ SWR is a data-fetching strategy that shows cached data while simultaneously fetching fresh data. It’s used in frameworks like Next.js for a seamless user experience.
## *Explain API rate limiting and how to handle it.
✅ API rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make within a timeframe to prevent abuse. Handle it using exponential backoff, caching, and monitoring error responses.

10. What are Synthetic Events in React?
- Synthetic events are React's wrapper around the browser’s native events.
- They ensure cross-browser compatibility and behave like native events.

📚 Example:
function ClickButton() {
 const handleClick = (event) => {
 console.log('Clicked!', event.type);
 };
 return <button onClick​={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
11. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
- package.json: Lists project dependencies.
- package-lock.json: Locks versions for consistency across installs.

20. What is Forward Ref?
- Forwarding ref allows parent to pass a ref to child component.

const FancyInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
 <input ref={ref} />
));

21. What are Error Boundaries?
- Special components that catch JavaScript errors in children and display fallback UI.

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
 componentDidCatch(error, info) {
 // log error
 }
 render() {
 return this.state.hasError ? <h1>Something went wrong.</h1> : this.props.children;
 }
}

31. What are Portals in React?
- Used to render components outside the main DOM tree.
ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById("modal-root"));

how to handle render code

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);

| Type                     | Method                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Basic Rendering          | `return JSX`                              |
| Conditional Rendering    | `if` or ternary (`? :`)                   |
| List Rendering           | `array.map()` with `key` prop             |
| State-based Rendering    | Use `useState()` + `setState()`           |
| API Data Rendering       | Use `useEffect()` + fetch + render        |
| Render Props             | Pass render functions to child components |
| Error / Loading Handling | Use conditionals with `if/else`           |
