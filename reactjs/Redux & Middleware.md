Module 5: Redux & Middleware (Complete Notes)

‚úÖ Redux Core Concepts:

1. What is Redux?
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you manage and centralize application state.

2. Why Redux?

Centralized store for consistent state across components
Easier debugging and time-travel (via Redux DevTools)
Better testability
Ideal for large apps with complex state interactions

üîß Core Building Blocks
üîπ Store:
Entire state tree of the application.

import { configureStore } from '@redux/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({
    reducer : youreducer;
})

üîπ Actions:
Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.

const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
const addTodo = (text) => ({
  type: ADD_TODO,
  payload: text
});

üîπ Reducers:
Functions that take current state and an action, and return new state.

function todoReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

üöÄ Redux Toolkit (RTK)

Why RTK?

Reduces boilerplate
Built-in support for Immer and Thunk
Includes createSlice, configureStore, etc.

import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1,
    decrement: (state) => state - 1
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;

üîÅ Redux Middleware
Middleware intercepts actions before they reach the reducer. Useful for logging, async calls, etc.

üåÄ Redux Thunk

What:
Thunk is a middleware that lets you write async logic inside actions.

export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  dispatch({ type: 'SET_DATA', payload: data });
};

Interview Qs:

Q: When would you use Thunk?
I use Thunk when I need to handle simple async logic, like fetching data from an API, submitting a form, or chaining dispatches.
It‚Äôs perfect for scenarios where the async flow is linear and not too complex, and I want to keep logic close to the action creator.

Q: Can Thunk return another function?
Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what it does. Thunk replaces the action with a function that receives dispatch (and optionally getState).
This function allows you to perform async operations, and dispatch other actions manually based on the results.

export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  dispatch({ type: 'SET_DATA', payload: data });
};



‚ö° Redux Saga

What:
Redux Saga is a middleware that uses generator functions (function*) to manage complex side effects in a declarative way. You write "sagas" that can pause, resume, cancel, debounce, or retry tasks.

Saga uses generator functions to handle side effects (e.g., API calls, delays).

Benefits:
Better control over complex async flows
Declarative effects
Cancellation, debouncing, etc.


Example:

import { call, put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

function* fetchDataSaga() {
  const data = yield call(() => fetch('/api').then(res => res.json()));
  yield put({ type: 'SET_DATA', payload: data });
}

function* watchFetchData() {
  yield takeEvery('FETCH_DATA', fetchDataSaga);
}

Interview Qs:

 Q: When would you use Redux Saga over Thunk?
I choose Redux Saga when dealing with complex async flows ‚Äî like race conditions, background syncing, polling, or when I need to cancel, delay, or retry effects.
Saga is ideal for large apps where side effects become harder to manage with nested thunks.

What is call, put, and takeEvery?
How do you handle retries or cancellations?

üíæ Redux Persist

What:
Persists Redux state across page reloads using localStorage or sessionStorage.

import { persistStore, persistReducer } from 'redux-persist';
import storage from 'redux-persist/lib/storage';

const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage
};

const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);

üîç Practical Example: Product Cart with RTK + Thunk

Create productSlice with actions to fetch and store product data.
Use createAsyncThunk for API calls.
Configure store with middleware.
Connect to React components via useDispatch, useSelector.
Optionally add Redux Persist to retain cart items.
