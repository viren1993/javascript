üì¶ Module 6: Performance Optimization

## \*\* 1. Memoization:

Optimizes performance by memoizing the result of an expensive function.
Prevents recalculation unless dependencies change.

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

Use Case: Heavy calculations that don‚Äôt need to run on every render.

useCallback
Memoizes the function reference to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

const handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(), [dependency]);

Use Case: Passing functions to child components (avoids unnecessary re-renders).

React.memo
HOC that prevents functional component re-render if props haven't changed.

const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
return <div>{props.value}</div>;
});

Use Case: Reusable components with static props.

Interview Questions:

When do you use useMemo vs useCallback?
What is the difference between React.memo and useMemo?
How do you avoid unnecessary re-renders?

## \*\* 2. Lazy Loading

"Don't load something until you actually need it."

Instead of loading everything at once (which can be slow), you delay loading parts of your app ‚Äî like images, components, or data ‚Äî to make the initial load faster.

## \*\*Why Use Lazy Loading?

üöÄ Faster initial load time
üìâ Lower memory usage
üì° Less data downloaded upfront

React.lazy
Code splits by loading components lazily.
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

Wraps around lazy components to show fallback while loading.
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
<LazyComponent />
</Suspense>

Code Splitting & Chunking:

Break app into smaller bundles for faster load time
Each route/component loads only when needed

Interview Questions:

How does lazy loading improve performance?
When do you use Suspense?
What‚Äôs the difference between code splitting and chunking?

‚ÄúLazy loading improves performance by loading things only when needed ‚Äî like splitting React components with React.lazy, or images with loading='lazy'.‚Äù

| Optimization Strategy | Tool/Method                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Prevent Re-renders    | `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` |
| Lazy Load Components  | `React.lazy`, `Suspense`               |
| Clean Effects         | Proper cleanup in `useEffect`          |
| Efficient State       | React Query, Zustand                   |
| Debounce Input        | `lodash.debounce`                      |
| Tree Shaking          | Modular imports                        |
| Production Build      | `npm run build`                        |
| Analyze Performance   | React DevTools, Lighthouse             |
