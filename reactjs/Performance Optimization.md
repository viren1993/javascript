üì¶ Module 6: Performance Optimization

1. Memoization:

Optimizes performance by memoizing the result of an expensive function.
Prevents recalculation unless dependencies change.

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

Use Case: Heavy calculations that don‚Äôt need to run on every render.

useCallback
Memoizes the function reference to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

const handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(), [dependency]);

Use Case: Passing functions to child components (avoids unnecessary re-renders).

React.memo
HOC that prevents functional component re-render if props haven't changed.

const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
  return <div>{props.value}</div>;
});

Use Case: Reusable components with static props.

Interview Questions:

When do you use useMemo vs useCallback?
What is the difference between React.memo and useMemo?
How do you avoid unnecessary re-renders?

2. Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a design pattern that delays loading components or resources until they are actually needed ‚Äî usually at the moment they're about to appear on screen. This reduces the initial load time, improves performance, and provides a better user experience.

React.lazy
Code splits by loading components lazily.
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

Wraps around lazy components to show fallback while loading.
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>

Code Splitting & Chunking:

Break app into smaller bundles for faster load time
Each route/component loads only when needed

Interview Questions:

How does lazy loading improve performance?
When do you use Suspense?
What‚Äôs the difference between code splitting and chunking?

üîç Practical: Build a Dashboard

Use React.lazy to load dashboard widgets/components lazily

Optimize props using React.memo
Wrap heavy logic with useMemo
Memoize callbacks for passing handlers
