1. What is HTML?
- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard text formatting language used for developing web pages released in 1993. HTML is a language that is interpreted by the browser and it tells the browser what to display and how to display.

1. Can we display a web page inside a web page or Is nesting of webpages possible?
- <iframe src=‚Äùurl of the web page to embed‚Äù />

2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?
- Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. For example, <p align=‚Äù center‚Äù>Interview questions</p>, 

3. What are void elements in HTML?
- HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.

5. What are HTML Entities?
- In HTML some characters are reserved like ‚Äò<‚Äô, ‚Äò>‚Äô, ‚Äò/‚Äô, etc. To use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities.

6. What are different types of lists in HTML?
- unorder list , order list 

8. What is the difference between the ‚Äòid‚Äô attribute and the ‚Äòclass‚Äô attribute of HTML elements?
- id can at time 1 used class samem value mutiple time

10. Describe HTML layout    .
  <header>: Stores the starting information about the web page.
  <footer>: Represents the last section of the page.
  <nav>: The navigation menu of the HTML page.
  <article>: It is a set of information.
  <section>: It is used inside the article block to define the basic structure of a page.
  <aside>: Sidebar content of the page.

11. How to optimize website assets loading?
  CDN hosting - A CDN or content delivery network is geographically distributed servers to help reduce latency.
  File compression - This is a method that helps to reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer
  File concatenation - This reduces the number of HTTP calls
  Minify scripts - This reduces the overall file size of js and CSS files
  Parallel downloads - Hosting assets in multiple subdomains can help to bypass the download limit of 6 assets per domain of all modern browsers. This can be configured but most general users never modify these settings.
  Lazy Loading - Instead of loading all the assets at once, the non-critical assets can be loaded on a need basis.

13. What are the different kinds of Doctypes available?
 - Strict Doctype 
 - Transitional Doctype
 - Frameset Doctype

20. Is it possible to change an inline element into a block level element?
Yes, it is possible using the ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù property with its value as ‚Äúblock‚Äù, to change the inline element into a block-level element.

22. In how many ways you can display HTML elements?
  inline: Using this we can display any block-level element as an inline element. The height and width attribute values of the element will not affect.
  block: using this, we can display any inline element as a block-level element. 
  inline-block: This property is similar to inline, except by using the display as inline-block, we can actually format the element using height and width values.
  flex: It displays the container and element as a flexible structure. It follows flexbox property.
  inline-flex: It displays the flex container as an inline element while its content follows the flexbox properties.
  grid: It displays the HTML elements as a grid container.
  none: Using this property we can hide the HTML element.

4. What is semantic HTML? Can you give examples?
Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags to improve accessibility and SEO.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	<header> (top section)
‚Ä¢	<article> (self-contained content)
‚Ä¢	<nav> (navigation links)
‚Ä¢	<section> (page section)
What is the difference between <strong> and <b>


Common Block-Level Elements

1. Structural Elements
<div> - Generic block container
<header> - Introductory content
<footer> - Footer content
<section> - Thematic grouping
<article> - Self-contained composition
<aside> - Tangentially related content
<nav> - Navigation links
<main> - Dominant content

2. Text Containers
<p> - Paragraph
<h1> to <h6> - Headings
<blockquote> - Long quotation
<pre> - Preformatted text

3. Lists
<ul>, <ol>, <li> - Unordered/ordered lists and list items
<dl>, <dt>, <dd> - Description lists

4. Form Elements
Form Elements

5. <table> - Tabular data
<hr> - Thematic break
<address> - Contact information

Key Characteristics of Block Elements
Layout Behavior:
Always start on a new line
Take up the full width available (unless styled otherwise)
Stack vertically by default

Can Contain:
Other block elements
Inline elements
Text conten


Dom event 
| Event       | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `click`     | When an element is clicked             |
| `input`     | When a user types in an input field    |
| `change`    | When a form element value changes      |
| `mouseover` | When the mouse enters an element       |
| `mouseout`  | When the mouse leaves an element       |
| `keydown`   | When a key is pressed down             |
| `submit`    | When a form is submitted               |
| `load`      | When the page or image is fully loaded |

Table click row 1 even listen 

<script>
  const firstRow = document.querySelector("#myTable tr");

  firstRow.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("First row clicked!");
  });
</script>

Why the Last Script File is Important in HTML
Key Reasons

Execution Order:
Scripts execute in the order they appear in the HTML
The last script runs after all previous ones have loaded/executed

Dependencies:
If scripts depend on libraries or variables defined in earlier scripts
The dependent script must come after its dependencies

DOM Readiness:
Scripts at the end of <body> can access fully loaded DOM
Avoids need for DOMContentLoaded or window.onload events


üîπ 1. Time Management Techniques
Break into small tasks ‚Äì Easier to estimate accurately.
Three-Point Estimation ‚Äì Use best, worst, and likely case for balance.
Historical Data ‚Äì Refer to past work for realistic timing.
Add buffer (20‚Äì30%) ‚Äì For unknowns or bugs.

adaptive design vs responsive design
‚úÖ Responsive Design
Definition: A single flexible layout that automatically adjusts to any screen size using fluid grids, percentages, and media queries.
Example: A website layout rearranges itself smoothly when resizing the browser window.
Pros: One codebase fits all devices, easier maintenance.
Tools: CSS Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries

‚úÖ Adaptive Design
Definition: Multiple fixed layouts designed for specific screen sizes (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px).
Example: A different layout loads for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Pros: Optimized experience for each device.
Cons: More complex, higher maintenance.

Core Concepts of REST API
Stateless: Each request is independent and contains all necessary information.

Uses HTTP methods:

GET ‚Äì Retrieve data
POST ‚Äì Create data
PUT ‚Äì Update data
DELETE ‚Äì Remove data

Resource-based: Everything is a resource identified by a URL.

Uses JSON (commonly) for sending/receiving data.

üîê What is HTTPS?
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.
Uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data between browser and server.

Ensures:

‚úÖ Data encryption (privacy)
‚úÖ Data integrity (no tampering)
‚úÖ Authentication (verifies server identity)

üåê HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 (both support HTTPS)
| Feature          | **HTTP/1.1**                   | **HTTP/2**                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Request Handling | One request per connection     | Multiplexing: multiple requests at once |
| Speed            | Slower (head-of-line blocking) | Faster (parallel streams)               |
| Headers          | Text-based, large headers      | Binary, compressed headers              |
| Server Push      | ‚ùå Not supported                | ‚úÖ Can push assets before requested      |
| Connection Reuse | Limited                        | Efficient, fewer TCP connections        |

| Query Language | SQL                     | SQL via JS libraries     | JavaScript-style queries        |
| Best For       | Structured data, joins  | Full backend integration | Fast-changing/unstructured data |
| Scaling        | Vertical (mostly)       | Depends on DB            | Horizontal (built-in)           |
