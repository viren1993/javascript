## **Can you describe a challenging problem you faced in a React project and how you resolved it?

ðŸ”¹ React Hooks Usage in Projects
Question:
What kinds of React Hooks have you used in your projects, and why?

Sample Answer (AI + Real-world):
I've extensively used useState, useEffect, useRef, and useMemo. In AI-based projects or dashboard-like apps, useMemo and useCallback are essential to prevent expensive recalculations or re-renders, especially when dealing with API calls and visualizations. For shared state, I've used useContext or custom hooks.

Follow-up Q: Can you explain a custom hook you created?
A: I built a custom hook for debounced search to avoid unnecessary API calls when users type in a queryâ€”especially useful in NLP-based or ML-driven apps.

ðŸ”¹ State Management for Large-Scale Data
Question:
What state management approach do you use when working with large-scale data?

Sample Answer:
For large-scale or enterprise apps, I prefer Redux Toolkit with middleware like Redux Thunk or Saga to handle async actions cleanly. I also use RTK Query to handle API caching and auto-fetching. In performance-critical areas, I split states using useReducer locally to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

Bonus: I also use React Query in data-heavy AI dashboards to handle server state, caching, and background updates.

## *Code Performance and Optimization
Question:
How do you ensure your React code is performant and optimized?

Sample Answer:
I use multiple strategies:

Component Memoization: with React.memo and useMemo
Lazy loading: with React.lazy and Suspense for route/code splitting
Virtual DOM optimizations: via selective rendering and list virtualization using React Window
Profiling: Using React DevTools Profiler to detect bottlenecks
Dependency checks: Minimizing unnecessary dependencies in useEffect
Minified bundles: via Next.js or Webpack for tree shaking

## * Can you provide an example of a challenge you faced and how you resolved it?

When developing frontend applications using ReactJS, ensuring cross-browser compatibility is crucial. I achieve this by employing modern CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid layouts, as well as using tools like Autoprefixer to handle vendor prefixes. In a recent project, I encountered a challenge with CSS Grid not rendering correctly in older versions of Internet Explorer. To address this, I implemented a combination of flexbox fallbacks and a polyfill library to ensure consistent layout across different browsers. This strategy effectively resolved the issue and maintained cross-browser compatibility.
