## *Micro-Frontend Architecture
Micro-Frontend Architecture is a modern architectural approach to building web applications where a single application is composed of multiple smaller, independent frontend apps. It brings the principles of microservices to the frontend world.

üèóÔ∏è How Does Micro-Frontend Work?
Architecture Models:
1. Build-Time Integration:
2. Run-Time Integration (via JavaScript):
3. Server-Side Composition:
4. Client-Side Composition (most common):

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Frameworks
| Tool / Library                | Use Case / Notes                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-SPA**                | JavaScript framework to combine multiple frontends.           |
| **Webpack Module Federation** | Share modules between builds at runtime.                      |
| **Module Federation + Nx**    | Popular in mono-repos with shared libs.                       |
| **import-maps**               | Map modules to URLs without bundlers.                         |
| **Qiankun**                   | Micro-frontend framework built on Single-SPA (China popular). |

üß© Integration Approaches
| Approach            | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Component-Level** | Each micro-frontend provides a component (e.g., React component).     |
| **Route-Level**     | Each micro-frontend manages one or more pages (common in dashboards). |
| **Iframe (legacy)** | Simple isolation, but limited interactivity and performance.          |

üîÑ Use Cases
Large enterprise applications with multiple teams.
Incrementally migrating monoliths to modern stacks.
Platform products where teams build independent modules.
SaaS apps with plugin-like architectures.

üßµ Real-World Example
Imagine an e-commerce site:

1. Header & Footer: Team A (React)
2. Product Page: Team B (Vue)
3. Cart Page: Team C (Angular)
4. Reviews Widget: Team D (Web Components)

## **what Design Patterns you flow in project 

## *‚úÖ 1. Atomic Design (UI Architecture)
Where used: Component structuring in React.
Why: Encourages reusable, testable UI components.

components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atoms/       // Button, Input
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ molecules/   // FormField, SearchBar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ organisms/   // Navbar, ProductList
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/   // Layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/       // Route-based views

‚úÖ 2. Container-Presenter Pattern (Smart-Dumb Components)
Where used: Separating business logic from UI.
Why: Improves reusability and testability.

Example:

ProductContainer (fetches data, handles state)
ProductList (renders UI based on props)


‚úÖ 3. Factory Pattern
Where used: Dynamic component generation, service creation.
Why: Centralizes object/component creation logic.

const NotificationFactory = (type) => {
  switch(type) {
    case 'email': return new EmailNotification();
    case 'sms': return new SMSNotification();
  }
}

‚úÖ 4. Singleton Pattern
Where used: For global utilities or config instances (like Auth, AppConfig, Logger).
Why: To ensure only one instance of a class/service.

class AppConfig {
  static instance;
  constructor() {
    if (AppConfig.instance) return AppConfig.instance;
    AppConfig.instance = this;
  }
}

‚úÖ 5. MVC (on .NET backend)
Where used: Backend API design.
Why: Clearly separates model, controller logic, and data.

Example in .NET:

Model ‚Üí Order.cs
Controller ‚Üí OrderController.cs
View ‚Üí Frontend React Components (consumer of API)

‚úÖ 6. Redux (Flux Architecture)
Where used: Global state management in large-scale React apps.
Why: Predictable state management with unidirectional data flow.

Structure:
actions/
reducers/
store.js
selectors/

‚úÖ 7. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Where used: Using React Hooks as ViewModel layer.
Why: ViewModel (hooks) manage state logic, View (components) focus on UI.

// useAuth.js (ViewModel)
const useAuth = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const login = () => { ... };
  return { user, login };
};

// LoginComponent.jsx (View)
const LoginComponent = () => {
  const { user, login } = useAuth();
};


‚úÖ 8. Service Layer Pattern
Where used: In services/ folder to centralize API logic.
Why: Avoid repetition and separate API logic from UI.

// services/productService.js
export const fetchProducts = () => axios.get('/api/products');


‚úÖ 9. Observer Pattern (via Events or PubSub)
Where used: Event-based data updates (e.g., toast notifications, app state changes).
Why: Decouples components from the data producer.

Example: React Context or custom EventEmitters.

‚úÖ 10. Lazy Loading / Code Splitting
Where used: Route-based code optimization.
Why: Improve performance by loading components on-demand.

Example:
const ProductPage = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/ProductPage'));

üî∑ Final Tip: Prepare Your Own STAR Stories
Use the STAR technique for big project or problem questions:

Situation
Task
Action
Result

‚úÖ Q: How do you collaborate with backend (e.g., .NET)?

Understand API contracts (Swagger, Postman)
Communicate edge cases, expected response formats
Handle versioned APIs
Provide mock payloads for parallel development

‚úÖ Q: What kind of architecture did you follow in your frontend?
Component-based architecture using Atomic Design
MVVM with hooks as ViewModel
Redux Toolkit for global state
Folder separation for components, services, hooks, and pages


‚úÖ Q: How do you ensure performance optimization in React apps?
Code splitting using React.lazy
Memoization (useMemo, React.memo)
Virtualization (React Virtualized)
Image optimization, lazy loading
Avoid unnecessary re-renders

(React Virtualized) what why how 
‚úÖ What is React Virtualized?
React Virtualized is a library for efficiently rendering large lists, tables, and grids in React applications. It helps your app render only the visible part of long content, instead of rendering all items at once.

Library Link: https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized

‚úÖ Why Use React Virtualized?
Rendering thousands of DOM elements (like rows in a table) hurts performance ‚Äî it slows down your page, increases memory usage, and makes the browser laggy.

‚ÄúHow do you handle large data rendering in React?‚Äù
You can answer:
‚ÄúI use virtualization libraries like React Virtualized or React Window. These render only visible items to improve performance. I've used it in dashboards and infinite-scroll tables with over 10,000 records.‚Äù

So we use virtualization to:

‚ö° Improve rendering performance
‚úÖ Keep scrolling smooth
üß† Save memory and CPU usage
üß± Render only the visible DOM elements in the viewport

‚úÖ How React Virtualized Works
React Virtualized calculates which rows/items are visible in the scroll viewport and only renders those in the DOM.

As the user scrolls:
It unmounts out-of-view elements
Mounts new visible ones

Describe your proudest frontend project. What was your biggest technical challenge and how did you solve it?

## **What was your role in your company?
"I was a Senior Frontend Developer. Apart from coding, I handled planning UI components, integrating with APIs, conducting technical interviews, and mentoring juniors. I also contributed to defining frontend architecture ‚Äî deciding when to use Redux vs. Context API, setting up route guards, dynamic forms, and reusable component libraries.

## **How did you manage a project?
We followed Agile methodology with 2-week sprints. I worked closely with the product manager and backend team to break down features into tasks.

For example, during a reporting dashboard project, I led the frontend estimation, broke the work into reusable components (following Atomic Design), and tracked progress using Jira. I handled critical parts like chart rendering with Chart.js, filters, and live search, and participated in sprint reviews and demos

## *Collaboration & communication: ‚ÄúHow do you manage cross-functional team efforts?‚Äù
## ** Problem solving & issue resolution: ‚ÄúHow do you handle urgent technical issues?‚Äù
## **System Design (Important)

Be ready to design a scalable module or integration system (like SAS).
Cover: architecture, tech stack, performance/scalability, security, error handling.

## *Why does updating state using useState not always lead to a re-render?
React shallowly compares the new state with the previous one. If the value hasn‚Äôt changed (e.g., primitive equality), React skips the re-render. Also, updates are batched and asynchronous, which can lead to skipped renders if not handled properly.

## **3. How can you prevent unnecessary re-renders when using useState?
Expected Answer:

Use functional updates: setState(prev => newState) to avoid stale closures.
Memoize components with React.memo.
Use useCallback/useMemo to avoid creating new references on each render.
Structure state properly‚Äîavoid excessive granularity or deep object nesting.

## ** What are the performance implications of using multiple useState vs. a single useReducer?
Expected Answer:
Multiple useState calls may lead to fragmented state updates and unpredictable batching. useReducer centralizes state logic and can be more performant when dealing with complex state objects or interdependent state variables.

## ** Advanced Debugging: A component updates state but doesn't re-render. What could be the reasons?
Possible Causes:

Same value passed to setState (e.g., setCount(count)).
State updated in a non-React event (not batched).
Improper use of React.memo blocking re-render.
Parent component not passing updated props due to memoization.
