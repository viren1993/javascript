1. Static Site Generation (SSG)

Definition:
SSG pre-builds all pages of a website at build time (during deployment). The pages are served as static HTML files, making them extremely fast and cache-friendly.

How It Works:
Build Phase:

All pages are generated when the site is deployed (e.g., using npm run build in Next.js).
Data is fetched from APIs, CMS (like WordPress, Sanity), or Markdown files.
HTML, CSS, and JS files are pre-rendered.

Serving Phase:

The pre-built static files are served via a CDN (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS CloudFront).
No server-side processing is needed for each request.

Advantages:
‚úÖ Blazing Fast (No server-side rendering delay)
‚úÖ Great for SEO (Pre-rendered HTML is crawlable)
‚úÖ Scalable (CDN handles traffic effortlessly)
‚úÖ Security (No direct server/database exposure)

Disadvantages:
‚ùå Not ideal for highly dynamic content (Requires rebuild for updates)
‚ùå Longer build times for large sites

Best Use Cases:
Blogs (e.g., Gatsby, Hugo)
Marketing websites
Documentation sites
E-commerce product pages (if content doesn‚Äôt change often)

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();
  return { props: { posts } };
}

export default function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}


2. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISG)
ISG is an advanced SSG where static pages are regenerated on-demand after deployment, either at a set interval or when triggered.

How It Works:
1. Initial Build:
Pages are pre-rendered at build time (like SSG).

2. Revalidation:
After deployment, pages can be updated:
    Time-based (Stale-While-Revalidate):

    export async function getStaticProps() {
        return { props: {}, revalidate: 60 }; // Regenerate every 60 seconds
    }

    await res.revalidate('/page-path');

3. Serving:

Users see the cached version until the page regenerates.

Advantages:
‚úÖ Best of both worlds (Static + Dynamic updates)
‚úÖ No full rebuild needed (Only updates changed pages)
‚úÖ Great for frequently changing data (e.g., e-commerce, news)

Disadvantages:
‚ùå Slightly slower than pure SSG (First request after revalidation may be delayed)
‚ùå Requires serverless/edge functions (For on-demand revalidation)

Best Use Cases:
News websites
E-commerce (product prices/availability)
Dashboards with semi-real-time data
User-generated content (with caching)

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/latest-news');
  const news = await res.json();
  return { 
    props: { news },
    revalidate: 30, // Regenerate every 30 seconds
  };
}

SSG vs ISG Comparison
Feature	SSG	ISG
Build Time	All pages built at deploy	Only initial pages built
Updates	Requires full rebuild	Revalidates in the background
Performance	Fastest	Slightly slower (if regenerating)
Use Case	Fully static content	Semi-dynamic content
Example	Blog, Docs	News, E-commerce

‚úÖ SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
SSR stands for Server-Side Rendering, a technique used in web development where HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client (browser), instead of relying entirely on the browser (client-side) to render the page.

‚öôÔ∏è What's Happening Under the Hood
User Requests Page: When a user visits /news, Next.js runs getServerSideProps on the server.
Server Fetches Data: The server fetches the latest data (e.g., from an API or database).
Render HTML on Server: The React component is rendered into HTML using the fetched data.
Send to Browser: The fully-rendered HTML is sent to the client, improving SEO and load time for dynamic content.
Hydration: React takes over the page on the client side for interactivity.


üíß Hydration Process
Server sends HTML + JSON: The server renders the page as HTML and sends it along with serialized data (props).
React loads on the client: React JavaScript bundle runs in the browser.
Reacts matches the HTML: React ‚Äúhydrates‚Äù the static HTML by attaching event listeners and making it a full React app.
Now interactive: The page is now fully functional ‚Äî users can click, navigate, etc.

| Data Fetching | `fetch` option            | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Static        | `cache: 'force-cache'`    | Same as `getStaticProps`                   |
| Dynamic       | `cache: 'no-store'`       | Same as `getServerSideProps`               |
| ISR           | `next: { revalidate: x }` | Same as `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` |
