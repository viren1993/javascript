#### **1. Prototypes & Inheritance**

__proto__ vs prototype

JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can inherit properties from other objects.

__proto__ (Dunder Proto)
- A property of every object (except Object.create(null)) that points to the prototype object from which it was inherited.
- Used to access the prototype chain.
- It is not recommended to modify __proto__ directly due to performance issues.

const obj = { key: "value" };
console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
