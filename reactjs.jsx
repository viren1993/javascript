// hooks
// hooks is a function that lets you hook into react state and lifecycle features from function components

// - useState 
// - useEffect
// - useContext
// - useReducer
// - useCallback
// - useMemo
// - useRef
// above all are the hooks with the example

// Stateless component - is not have any chnage the pass on the props
// statefull component - is have the change the pass on the props

// state and props are controll and manage the component behave and render

// state is mutable and props is immutable
// state chanage the data and props pass the data

// controll component - is from on chnage funcation to sued 
// uncontrol component - is from on ref to used

/// hight order component
// - HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component
// - HOC is a pattern where a function takes a component and returns a new component
 // what, why , how , why ---- with practical example

 // 3 - life cycle method of component -- 3 face mount, update, unmount
 // - call component
// - render component

// React Component Lifecycle Methods
// React components go through a lifecycle with three main phases:
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mounting (Component is created and inserted into the DOM)
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Updating (Component updates due to state/props changes)
// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Unmounting (Component is removed from the DOM)

// Lifecycle methods are available only in class components, 
// but functional components use React Hooks (useEffect, useState, etc.) to handle similar behavior

// 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lifecycle Methods in Functional Components (useEffect Hook)

// In functional components, the useEffect Hook replaces lifecycle methods.
// Class Component Method	             useEffect Equivalent
// componentDidMount	                 useEffect(() => {}, [])
// componentDidUpdate	                 useEffect(() => {}, [dependency])
// componentWillUnmount	                 useEffect(() => { return () => cleanup(); }, [])

// 4 - State Management (All abount data)
// - state / props
// - props driling
// - contex - data pass on 1 component to another component

// React State Management (All About Data)
// State management in React helps handle and pass data between components. There are multiple ways to manage state:

//Stores dynamic data inside a component	
// Mutable (Can change using setState or useState)	
// Inside a single component	

/// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Props Drilling (Passing Data Through Multiple Components)
// - Passing data from a parent component to a child component
// üìå Solution: Context API (No need to pass props manually).

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Context API (Global State)
// Method	Best For
// State (useState)	Managing local component data
// Props	Passing data from parent to child
// Props Drilling	Works but gets complex if deeply nested
// Context API	Sharing global data without prop drilling

// 5 - Redux
// - redux - global state management - why, what, how, why - with practical example
// / rtk - redux toolkit
// - redux thunk - middleware
// - redux saga - middleware
// - redux persist - middleware

// 6 - Custom Hooks
// - when, why, how - with practical example
// - best answe why used custom hook code clean - matainablity - reusability - readability

// 7 - lazy loading
// - code splitting - why, what, how, why - with practical example
// - code chunking
// - code suspense

// 8 - vartual dom
// - reconciliation
// - diffing algorithm
// - react fiber
// - react concurrent mode

// ssr - csr - ssg - isr - why, what, how, why - with practical example

// 9 - react router
// RBAC - role based access control
// - how can protect the route


// async task
// - api call
// - events

// use effect how can work behind the scene


// 10 - react testing
// - jest
