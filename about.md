Hi, I’m Viren Parmar — a Frontend Developer with over 6 years of experience, including 3+ years of hands-on expertise in React.js, Redux, TypeScript, and modern frontend technologies.

Currently, I’m part of the core development team at Vashishth Technologies, where I contribute to building high-performance, scalable applications such as ONS Trading and CrSIP — crypto-focused platforms featuring WebSocket-powered live data, arbitrage tools, and automated investment workflows.

My core strengths lie in crafting responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly user interfaces using React.js, Redux Toolkit, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. I also bring experience in Web3 integration, working with blockchain APIs and wallet connectivity to create seamless crypto user experiences.

Previously, I’ve worked with Accelerated Business Solutions and PeaceInfotech, where I focused on cross-browser compatibility, accessibility, and building dynamic UI components that enhance usability and performance.

I value clean, maintainable code, component-based architecture, and collaborative development environments. I’m now seeking opportunities in product-based companies where I can work on impactful projects and continue growing in a fast-paced, innovative setting.

cover letter 
I am a Frontend Developer with over 6 years of experience, including 3+ years of hands-on work with React.js, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and Next.js. At Vashishth Technologies, I’ve built and maintained scalable, real-time applications such as ONS Trading and CrSIP, involving WebSocket-based data, arbitrage tools, and Web3 integration. I specialize in clean, maintainable code and responsive, SEO-optimized UI development using modern frameworks. I’m seeking a product-based role where I can contribute to impactful projects and grow in a fast-paced, innovative environment.

## **Here’s a clear and professional way to describe your current responsibilities and project ownership in English:

At my current company, I’m responsible for end-to-end development of frontend projects. I work closely with 2 graphic designers who provide UI/UX designs, and I take full ownership from interpreting those designs to building fully functional, responsive, and scalable frontend applications.

For one major project, I handled the entire frontend setup from scratch — including folder structure, routing, API integration, global state management (using Redux Toolkit), component development, SEO optimization, and deployment. I ensure the project meets performance standards, accessibility guidelines, and works smoothly across devices and browsers.

I also coordinate with the backend team for API structure, handle integration, and test for edge cases to ensure a seamless user experience.


Two recent projects I’m proud of are CrSIP and ONS Trading, both developed at Vashishth Technologies.
