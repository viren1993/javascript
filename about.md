Hi, I’m Viren Parmar — a Frontend Developer with over 6 years of experience, including 3+ years of hands-on expertise in React.js, Redux, TypeScript, and modern frontend technologies.

Currently, I’m part of the core development team at Vashishth Technologies, where I contribute to building high-performance, scalable applications such as ONS Trading and CrSIP — crypto-focused platforms featuring WebSocket-powered live data, arbitrage tools, and automated investment workflows.

My core strengths lie in crafting responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly user interfaces using React.js, Redux Toolkit, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. I also bring experience in Web3 integration, working with blockchain APIs and wallet connectivity to create seamless crypto user experiences.

Previously, I’ve worked with Accelerated Business Solutions and PeaceInfotech, where I focused on cross-browser compatibility, accessibility, and building dynamic UI components that enhance usability and performance.

I value clean, maintainable code, component-based architecture, and collaborative development environments. I’m now seeking opportunities in product-based companies where I can work on impactful projects and continue growing in a fast-paced, innovative setting.
