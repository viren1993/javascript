"Sure! My name is Viren Parmar, and I’m a Frontend Developer with over 6 years of total experience and around 3+ years of hands-on experience in React.js, Redux, TypeScript, and modern frontend technologies.

I’m currently working at Vashishth Technologies, where I’ve been part of a core development team building high-performance, scalable applications like ONS Trading and CrSIP — both crypto-based platforms with features like WebSocket-based live data, arbitrage calculations, and crypto investment automation.

I specialize in building responsive and SEO-optimized UI using React.js, Redux Toolkit, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. I also have experience working with Web3, integrating blockchain wallets and APIs. Prior to this, I worked at Accelerated Business Solutions and PeaceInfotech, where I focused on accessibility, cross-browser compatibility, and dynamic web interfaces.

I enjoy clean code, component-based architecture, and collaborating with teams to build user-friendly products. I’m currently looking for a product-based company where I can contribute to meaningful projects and also grow in an innovative and fast-paced environment."**
